# County Permits
In this project I took two datasets from data Montgomery and used them to see trends in the County.
The data sets contain all of the commercial and residential permits issued from 2000 until the 2019.
I saw all of the different kinds of permits that the county issued and focused on the wait time of a permit's issuing and housing trends and solar panels.

* 2nd data set Residential Permits https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Licenses-Permits/Residential-Permit/m88u-pqki
